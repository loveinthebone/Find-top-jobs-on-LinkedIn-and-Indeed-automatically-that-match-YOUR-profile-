# Find-top-jobs-on-LinkedIn-and-Indeed-automatically-that-match-YOUR-profile-

In this project, I share with you a method to find top jobs on LinkedIn and Indeed that match YOUR profile automatically. 
This method first use web scraping based on Beautifulsoup and Selenium to extract job posts data from Indeed and LinkedIn, then use a simple resume screening technique to sort the job posts according to its similarity to the user's profile.

A recording of the real time running of the job searching and sorting program can be found in this video:

A detailed description of a similar workflow on Indeed job searching and filtering can be found in my first publication of this project:
