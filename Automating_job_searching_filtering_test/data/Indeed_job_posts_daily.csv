Job Context– Accell Supply Chain
Accell Group’s supply chain is complex, caused by our many products, suppliers, countries and consumer profiles. Accell’s business is segmented in Bicycles (OEM) and Part & Accessories (P&A), each with its own dynamics. Bicycles are assembled by Accell and 3rd party suppliers. The frames and components are externally sourced, mostly in Asia. Assembly operations are closely located to the end markets to shorten lead times with local component inventories on site. The bicycle business is dominated by seasonality which can differ from country to country, a typical season runs from September until August with a delivery peak to dealers and consumers starting from February.
The group strategy focus is on high end, and premium bicycle market. Accell differentiates itself from the competition through innovations – these innovations require tailored components with relative low volumes. Coordination and working together with suppliers in the development process and supply chain is critical. Demand management is key as consumer behaviour is becoming less predictable and demand is highly volatile.
Accell Group has moved towards a centre-led supply chain organisation model. The aim is to significantly improve profitability and working capital reduction.
The Group Procurement Director, reporting to the Chief Supply Chain Officer, is responsible for our procurement team focussing on category management, supplier development and sourcing. He actively engages with the operating companies and suppliers in order to develop and implement the procurement strategy as part of the supply chain vision.
Testimonials of employees working this role:
-
For almost 3 years I have been working as a procurement analyst. The day of a procurement analyst is very diverse and eventful. From making high level spend overviews to calculating in-depth BOM (Bill of Material) change and savings results. As a procurement analyst, you do not only work with the Global Procurement team but also with the Global Finance, Global Data, BI, and local operating companies. This way you are exposed to different disciplines getting a better understanding of the whole business.
In the role I had the opportunity to develop myself further by learning on the job, through joining strategic meetings, where there is always room to express your own opinions and ideas. But there was also the possibility for studies and courses. Eventually, this has led to an internal promotion as new product introduction coordinator.
Overall, I enjoyed working as a procurement analyst a lot. The team is very open and helpful and there are a lot of possibilities to make an impact on the business.
-
The role of Procurement Analyst has been my first job after graduating for my Masters degree. The job offers a lot of freedom and space to develop yourself, both personally and professionally, and gives you the chance to interact with many different functions, departments and people across the world. That all made the job for me the perfect challenge after my studies. It eventually gave me the opportunity to make a promotion to another role in the same team as well. So far I have never regretted my decision to go for this job and every time when I walk through one of our factories I’m always proud of what we accomplish as a team and proud of the amazing products we are making.

Why is it so hard to predict population dynamics of rodents both in urban and rural landscapes? We think that behavioural change of individuals under different demographic and environmental conditions plays a key role. An enhanced understanding of this aspect will lead to more effective actions by the terrain managing organisations.
The animal movement ecology group at the University of Amsterdam is developing ideas and enhancing our understanding through closely linked monitoring and predictive modeling with parameter rich models in two different systems: rural areas with muskrat and coypu and urban landscapes with brown rat as focal species. In both systems, population size will be monitored along with biodiversity, relevant environmental and anthropogenic variables. Also, small experiments will be conducted to identify key factors influencing behaviour and demography. The study sites are part of two larger projects, so the research will be collaborative. The fieldwork related to biodiversity monitoring will f.i. be done close collaboration with project partners. Linked to this research, we educate MSc students in the Environmental Sciences as well as Ecology and Evolution to effectively apply modeling and data analysis in their fields.
We are seeking an ambitious postdoc with a strong track record in quantitative ecological research to pick-up the challenge and make the research and teaching activities sketched above a success.
What are you going to do?
You are expected to:
help in the design of field monitoring by project collaborators and experimental activities by MSc students and coordinate the execution of these activities (0.2 FTE);

take part in the teaching effort of the group, including supervision of bachelor and master thesis projects and lecturing in an MSc course on quantitative ecology (0.2 FTE);
be active in presenting your research, both within our institute and the international scientific community.
What do we require?
a PhD in (quantitative) ecology or related field;
a solid scientific expertise in ecological modeling and statistics, reflected among others by scientific publications;
a willingness to teach at undergraduate and graduate levels – prior experience in teaching is a pre;

phd position interaction chemistry between fission products and lead/lead-bismuth eutectic coolant,TU Delft,2020_08_03,https://www.indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=6c29ea2e5ffab8e5&fccid=43dfbb216f29aaed&vjs=3,"PhD Position Interaction Chemistry Between Fission Products and Lead/Lead-Bismuth Eutectic Coolant
Job description
Light water reactors (LWRs) are currently the reference in the nuclear industry, but do not provide a fully satisfying response to the social-political concerns. To replace these reactors at the end of their operating licenses, Generation IV reactors are currently being developed. Lead and Lead-Bismuth cooled Fast Reactors were selected as one of the most promising designs by the International Generation IV Forum. Liquid lead (Pb) and lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) are particularly appealing as metallic coolants due to their high boiling points and chemical inertness with respect to air and water. In case of a clad breach, although extremely rare under normal operating conditions, the Pb/LBE coolant could come into contact with the irradiated nuclear fuel. (U,Pu)O2 is currently the reference for such type of reactor. From safety perspectives, it is essential to have a thorough knowledge of the potential products of interaction between the Pb/LBE coolant and the ceramic fuel. Depending on conditions of temperature and oxygen potential, new interaction phases can form with lower density and thermal conductivity than the fuel, which leads to fuel swelling and temperature increase, thus affecting the fuel behaviour. In addition, volatile and semi-volatile fission products such as cesium (Cs), iodine (I), molybdenum (Mo) and barium (Ba) are generated with a high fission yield during irradiation in the reactor, which are a primary concern for the public as they are the main cause for the radiological consequences of a severe accident. To assess the source term (the potential release of fission products to the environment in an accidental scenario), the interaction products between Pb/LBE and those fission products also need to be scrutinized.
The goal of this PhD will be to improve the understanding of the very poorly known chemistry of the interaction between lead and lead-bismuth eutectic coolant, fuel and key fission products, in particular the conditions required for the formation of ternary and quaternary phases, their thermal stability and thermodynamic properties, which is essential for the safety assessment of the reactor during operation and accidental conditions.
To achieve this, the candidate will look at the structural and thermodynamic properties of the ternary and quaternary phases in the (Pb-Bi)-(U-Cs-I-Mo-Ba)-O system. The work will involve solid state synthesis and characterization using X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, the study of the compounds thermal expansion using high temperature X-ray diffraction, as well as calorimetric measurements of the thermodynamic properties, and measurements of the vapour pressures and retention capacity of Cs and I fission products in Pb and LBE using Knudsen Effusion Mass Spectrometry. In addition, interaction tests between irradiated fast reactor fuel and Pb/LBE will be performed in the hot cells at the Joint Research Centre-Karlsruhe. The collected experimental data will serve as input to develop thermodynamic models of these systems using the CALPHAD method with the Thermocalc and Factsage softwares.
As part of the PhD project, the candidate will supervise bachelor and/or master students, and will contribute to some educational activities.
This PhD position involves a close collaboration between the Department of Radiation Science and Technology (RST) of TU Delft and the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission in Karlsruhe (JRC Karlsruhe). Moreover, the close collaboration with the Reactor Institute Delft (RID) guarantees access to the HOR (Hoger Onderwijs reactor) research reactor and the irradiation facilities.
Requirements
We are looking for an outstanding candidate with a master degree in Chemistry, Materials Science, Applied Science or a related field. Candidate should have an affinity for multidisciplinary fields of research and a hands-on attitude towards experimental work. Computer skills in simulation and modelling are also desirable. We expect creativity, flexibility and ability to co-operate within an interdisciplinary research group. Excellent communication skills, including good written and spoken English, as well as the ability to conduct independent scientific work are required. Delft University of Technology is a bilingual organisation; fluency in English is essential.
Conditions of employment
TU Delft offers PhD-candidates a 4-year contract, with an official go/no go progress assessment after one year. Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities, increasing from € 2395 per month in the first year to € 3061 in the fourth year. As a PhD candidate you will be enrolled in the TU Delft Graduate School. The TU Delft Graduate School provides an inspiring research environment with an excellent team of supervisors, academic staff and a mentor. The Doctoral Education Programme is aimed at developing your transferable, discipline-related and research skills.

Job Context– Accell Supply Chain
Accell Group’s supply chain is complex, caused by our many products, suppliers, countries and consumer profiles. Accell’s business is segmented in Bicycles (OEM) and Part & Accessories (P&A), each with its own dynamics. Bicycles are assembled by Accell and 3rd party suppliers. The frames and components are externally sourced, mostly in Asia. Assembly operations are closely located to the end markets to shorten lead times with local component inventories on site. The bicycle business is dominated by seasonality which can differ from country to country, a typical season runs from September until August with a delivery peak to dealers and consumers starting from February.
The group strategy focus is on high end, and premium bicycle market. Accell differentiates itself from the competition through innovations – these innovations require tailored components with relative low volumes. Coordination and working together with suppliers in the development process and supply chain is critical. Demand management is key as consumer behaviour is becoming less predictable and demand is highly volatile.
Accell Group has moved towards a centre-led supply chain organisation model. The aim is to significantly improve profitability and working capital reduction.
The Group Procurement Director, reporting to the Chief Supply Chain Officer, is responsible for our procurement team focussing on category management, supplier development and sourcing. He actively engages with the operating companies and suppliers in order to develop and implement the procurement strategy as part of the supply chain vision.
Testimonials of employees working this role:
-
For almost 3 years I have been working as a procurement analyst. The day of a procurement analyst is very diverse and eventful. From making high level spend overviews to calculating in-depth BOM (Bill of Material) change and savings results. As a procurement analyst, you do not only work with the Global Procurement team but also with the Global Finance, Global Data, BI, and local operating companies. This way you are exposed to different disciplines getting a better understanding of the whole business.
In the role I had the opportunity to develop myself further by learning on the job, through joining strategic meetings, where there is always room to express your own opinions and ideas. But there was also the possibility for studies and courses. Eventually, this has led to an internal promotion as new product introduction coordinator.
Overall, I enjoyed working as a procurement analyst a lot. The team is very open and helpful and there are a lot of possibilities to make an impact on the business.
-
The role of Procurement Analyst has been my first job after graduating for my Masters degree. The job offers a lot of freedom and space to develop yourself, both personally and professionally, and gives you the chance to interact with many different functions, departments and people across the world. That all made the job for me the perfect challenge after my studies. It eventually gave me the opportunity to make a promotion to another role in the same team as well. So far I have never regretted my decision to go for this job and every time when I walk through one of our factories I’m always proud of what we accomplish as a team and proud of the amazing products we are making.

pd: realization and physics of hybrid photon-spintronic devices,TU Eindhoven,2020_08_03,https://www.indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=99ea78503ab5c0bd&fccid=b357aa510b1bb882&vjs=3,"Job description
The main subject of research is the realization and experimental study of photonic waveguides with nanostructured ferromagnetic claddings for added spintronic functionality, using state of the art fabrication and characterisation methods. Added functionality will include current-induced chiral magnetic domain wall motion in (synthetic-) ferrimagnetic structures, magneto-optical mode conversion and all-optical switching of magnetization using ps light pulses. The postdoc will take the lead in this research, to be implemented together with several PhD students within the larger NWO Gravitation research project on Integrated NanoPhotonics of the Applied Physics and Electronic Engineering departments at the Eindhoven University of Technology.
This project will be carried out in the group Physics of Nanostructure at the department of Applied Physics of the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). The position is part of the Gravitation project on Integrated NanoPhotonics.
Research
The fascinating possibility to combine on-chip photonics, spintronic functionality and magneto-optical conversion and in a single device directly combining high bandwidth data transport and storage may have a huge impact on the realization of future data and memory architectures. The recent demonstrations of highly efficient current-induced chiral domain wall motion in ferrimagnetic structures and the single-pulse all-optical-switching of magnetic domains bring this prospect one step further to reality. In the Gravitation project on Integrated Nanophotonics at the TU/e and the Integrated Photonics Institute (IPI) we are exploring this multi-disciplinary approach, which could add a revolutionary functionality to photonic circuits whilst breaking ground in the fundamentals of current induced domain wall motion in ferrimagnetic material systems.
Job requirements
For this function we are looking for a talented and highly motivated candidate, with either a physics or an electrical engineering background with demonstrated affinity with experimental physics. The candidate should hold a recently obtained PhD degree when starting the position. Experience in the field of nanomagnetism / spintronics, (ultrafast) magneto-optics, and/or hybrid photonic approaches is required and the candidate should display the creativity and drive to explore the integration of novel magneto-optical and chiral domain-wall developments into photonic integrated circuits. Candidates must prove a strong attitude towards experimental physics and the drive and capacity to tackle different aspects of a complex problem with large independence. The position is for two years and is embedded in a larger research cluster with other partners.
Conditions of employment
a challenging job in a dynamic and ambitious university and a stimulating internationally renowned research environment;
full-time temporary appointment for 2 years;
gross salary between € 3.255 per month and € 3.637 per month (depending on background and work experience);
Additionally, 8% holiday and 8.3% end-of-year annual supplements;
