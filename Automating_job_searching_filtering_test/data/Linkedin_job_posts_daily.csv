PhD Position Interaction Chemistry Between Fission Products and Lead/Lead-Bismuth Eutectic Coolant,Technische Universiteit Delft,2020_08_03,https://nl.linkedin.com/jobs/view/phd-position-interaction-chemistry-between-fission-products-and-lead-lead-bismuth-eutectic-coolant-at-tu-delft-1946892363?refId=d6c16c1a-0b0a-46f6-81cf-c456b25b6a19&position=13&pageNum=0&trk=public_jobs_job-result-card_result-card_full-click,"Job Description
Light water reactors (LWRs) are currently the reference in the nuclear industry, but do not provide a fully satisfying response to the social-political concerns. To replace these reactors at the end of their operating licenses, Generation IV reactors are currently being developed. Lead and Lead-Bismuth cooled Fast Reactors were selected as one of the most promising designs by the International Generation IV Forum. Liquid lead (Pb) and lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) are particularly appealing as metallic coolants due to their high boiling points and chemical inertness with respect to air and water. In case of a clad breach, although extremely rare under normal operating conditions, the Pb / LBE coolant could come into contact with the irradiated nuclear fuel. (U, Pu) O2 is currently the reference for such type of reactor. From safety perspectives, it is essential to have a thorough knowledge of the potential products of interaction between the Pb / LBE coolant and the ceramic fuel. Depending on conditions of temperature and oxygen potential, new interaction phases can form with lower density and thermal conductivity than the fuel, which leads to fuel swelling and temperature increase, thus affecting the fuel behavior. In addition, volatile and semi-volatile fission products such as cesium (Cs), iodine (I), molybdenum (Mo) and barium (Ba) are generated with a high fission yield during irradiation in the reactor, which are a primary concern for the public as they are the main cause for the radiological consequences of a severe accident. To assess the source term (the potential release of fission products to the environment in an accidental scenario), the interaction products between Pb / LBE and those fission products also need to be scrutinized.
The goal of this PhD will be to improve the understanding of the very poorly known chemistry of the interaction between lead and lead-bismuth eutectic coolant, fuel and key fission products, in particular the conditions required for the formation of ternary and quaternary phases, their thermal stability and thermodynamic properties, which is essential for the safety assessment of the reactor during operation and accidental conditions.
To achieve this, the candidate will look at the structural and thermodynamic properties of the ternary and quaternary phases in the (Pb-Bi) - (U-Cs-I-Mo-Ba) -O system. The work will involve solid state synthesis and characterization using X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, the study of the compounds thermal expansion using high temperature X-ray diffraction, as well as calorimetric measurements of the thermodynamic properties, and measurements of the vapor pressures and retention capacity of Cs and I fission products in Pb and LBE using Knudsen Effusion Mass Spectrometry. In addition, interaction tests between irradiated fast reactor fuel and Pb / LBE will be performed in the hot cells at the Joint Research Center-Karlsruhe. The collected experimental data will serve as input to develop thermodynamic models of these systems using the CALPHAD method with the Thermocalc and Factsage softwares.
As part of the PhD project, the candidate will supervise bachelor and / or master students, and will contribute to some educational activities.
This PhD position involves a close collaboration between the Department of Radiation Science and Technology (RST) of TU Delft and the Joint Research Center of the European Commission in Karlsruhe (JRC Karlsruhe). Moreover, the close collaboration with the Reactor Institute Delft (RID) guarantees access to the HOR (Higher Education reactor) research reactor and the irradiation facilities.
Requirements
We are looking for an outstanding candidate with a master degree in Chemistry, Materials Science, Applied Science or a related field. Candidate should have an affinity for multidisciplinary fields of research and a hands-on attitude towards experimental work. Computer skills in simulation and modeling are also desirable. We expect creativity, flexibility and ability to co-operate within an interdisciplinary research group. Excellent communication skills, including good written and spoken English, as well as the ability to conduct independent scientific work are required. Delft University of Technology is a bilingual organization; fluency in English is essential.
Conditions of employment
TU Delft offers PhD candidates a 4-year contract, with an official go / no go progress assessment after one year. Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labor Agreement for Dutch Universities, increasing from € 2395 per month in the first year to € 3061 in the fourth year.

Added functionality will include current-induced chiral magnetic domain wall motion in (synthetic-) ferrimagnetic structures, magneto-optical mode conversion and all-optical switching of magnetization using ps light pulses. The postdoc will take the lead in this research, to be implemented together with several PhD students within the larger NWO Gravitation research project on Integrated NanoPhotonics of the Applied Physics and Electronic Engineering departments at the Eindhoven University of Technology.
This project will be carried out in the group Physics of Nanostructure at the department of Applied Physics of the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU / e). The position is part of the Gravitation project on Integrated NanoPhotonics.
Research
The fascinating possibility to combine on-chip photonics, spintronic functionality and magneto-optical conversion and in a single device directly combining high bandwidth data transport and storage may have a huge impact on the realization of future data and memory architectures. The recent demonstrations of highly efficient current-induced chiral domain wall motion in ferrimagnetic structures and the single-pulse all-optical-switching of magnetic domains bring this prospect one step further to reality. In the Gravitation project on Integrated Nanophotonics at the TU / e and the Integrated Photonics Institute (IPI) we are exploring this multi-disciplinary approach, which could add a revolutionary functionality to photonic circuits whilst breaking ground in the fundamentals of current induced domain wall motion in ferrimagnetic material systems.
Job Requirements
For this function we are looking for a talented and highly motivated candidate, with either a physics or an electrical engineering background with demonstrated affinity with experimental physics. The candidate should hold a recently obtained PhD degree when starting the position. Experience in the field of nanomagnetism / spintronics, (ultrafast) magneto-optics, and / or hybrid photonic approaches is required and the candidate should display the creativity and drive to explore the integration of novel magneto-optical and chiral domain-wall developments into photonic integrated circuits. Candidates must prove a strong attitude towards experimental physics and the drive and capacity to tackle different aspects of a complex problem with large independence. The position is for two years and is embedded in a larger research cluster with other partners.
Conditions of employment
a challenging job in a dynamic and ambitious university and a stimulating internationally renowned research environment;
full-time temporary appointment for 2 years;
gross salary between € 3,255 per month and € 3,637 per month (depending on background and work experience);

Arnhem (+ remote working), The Netherlands

Where the power grid ends, Wattsun begins

Wattsun helps companies with their on-site power demand with innovative products.
We create possibilities with a portable plug & play battery system. This new way of working helps professionals perform their work in a more sustainable, efficient and safer manner.
The problem
In today's world, electricity is an integral part of our lives. Everything we do requires energy. Western culture survives on electricity from an invisible grid. Outside there are no connections to the mains. This is a problem for companies. Today, aggregates are still used to generate electricity. This has many drawbacks.

In the event sector, construction and film sector, more than 100 million liters of fuel are burned per year. This goes together with pollution, noise, odor and high costs.

With the imminent climate change that we as an individual can no longer close our eyes to, organizations are increasingly held responsible for pollution.
Wattsun has opted for very high-quality Lithium-Ion cells in its own developed battery pack and Battery Management System (BMS). In recent years, several prototypes have been built that ultimately led to the current Wattsun products for which we have obtained a worldwide patent.

Due to our growth and product development, we are currently looking for an experienced Mechanical Engineer / Product Engineer.

The roll

You will become part of a small team that focuses on product development and the improvement, application and feasibility of (new) technology, i.e. from concept to manufacturability (within budget). Your tasks are mainly focused on the technical aspects of the entire process - from installing electronics components in our own developed housing, optimizing the design for assembly, to realizing cost savings. You take into account matters such as heat development, watertightness, strength & shock resistance. You work closely with the designer and co-founder of Wattsun, with the rest of the team and with external partners.

Your profile

You have 3-5 years of relevant work experience and you have a Bachelor's or Master's degree: Product Design / Mechanical Engineering - technical IPO.
You have knowledge of or experience with: technical design, development and construction of prototypes, plastic injection molding, metal, cable harnesses, design for assembly, technical drawing (SolidWorks). You may already have experience with battery technology and an affinity with sustainability, high-tech and innovation.
You are aware of various production techniques and their scalability.
You are a team player who can also work independently.
You are curious, flexible and enterprising, you can work in a structured manner and you are not afraid of the ambiguity of a scale-up.
You speak fluent English and Dutch.

We offer

Personal growth, freedom (no corporate culture) and sector experience within a small innovative and driven team. You can develop yourself, have growth opportunities (incl. International), you build an interesting network and ecosystem, in which you realize change & impact as part of the sustainable energy / transition.
