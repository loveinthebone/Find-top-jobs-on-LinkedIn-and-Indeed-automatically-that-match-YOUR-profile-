What are you going to do?
An IT boot camp?
Hell yes! Your foundation in the technical skills is laid in an eight-week intensive training, hence the name ""boot camp"". In the first 3 weeks you will cover the fundamentals of IT, such as topics such as: SCRUM, object-oriented programming, testing, front-end, UML, data and analysis. During these weeks we will look together at what you are good at and where the demand is in the market. When your strengths lie in processing data, you will specialize as a big data engineer. During the last 5 weeks you will deal with all the ins and outs of data processing and you will obtain 3 different certificates in this specialism. You will work with: Python, SQL, Hadoop and Power BI. You conclude the boot camp with a final assignment in which you will process a raw data set in a data warehouse.
And after completing the boot camp?
Then you enter the doors of your new client. You don't have to do all this alone, because you will be linked to a senior IT specialist who will intensively guide you during the two-year traineeship to become an independent professional, in order to take your career to the 'next level'. That is learning, working and earning in one.
What does your working day look like?
You come to the office, install yourself at your desk, grab a nice cup of coffee and make a schedule for today.
When you are allowed to start as a big data engineer, large amounts of data are central. You can edit and clean raw data in such a way that your colleagues can make analyzes with the right information. Subjects that occur daily are: Data Wrangling, Data Mining, PySpark, Informatica PowerCenter, Hadoop Ecosystem Overview, data warehouses and SQL. You can't get enough of researching, analyzing, extracting and programming data, so your day flies by and you go home with a big smile.
